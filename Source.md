The FTP for PHP source code repository will now be managed using the Git. You can browse the source, clone it, and submit patches at our new Github site at:

http://github.com/dg/ftp-php

If you don’t have Git, you need not fear. There is a tool to produce a ZIP file of latest version that’ll be kept up to date all the time.

This also means that development on the Subversion repository has stopped and will no longer be kept up to date. We’ll keep the Subversion repository around for some time for people to transition off svn:externals, though. But if you want the latest edge, you’ll have to use either Git or the new ZIP files.
